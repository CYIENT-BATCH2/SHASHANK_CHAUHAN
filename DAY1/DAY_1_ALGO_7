read the digit from the user
store the value in another variable
then perform reverse operation
first divide the number with 10 and take the remainder which will be last digit
after getting last digit multiply it with 10 and add the remainer to it
then divide the number with 10 and the last digit will be discarded
run the loop until the value becomes 0
print the value it will be reverse of given number
check if reverse
print is palindrome
else
print is not palindrome
