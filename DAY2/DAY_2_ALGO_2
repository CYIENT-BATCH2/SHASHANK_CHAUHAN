Enter the two digit number from user
store its value in variable
take another variable of i and takrs its value as 8 because we want to run the program 8 times
so we will get the output in 8 bits
Using goto we will decrement the value of i
again check the conditon
first shifting the number for 8 bits to right side using bitwise right shift and with 1
we will get the last bit 
print the bit 
again decrement the vaule to 7 till 0
and every time its right shifted by particular bit and with 1 
and it will print the binary vaule of the number
