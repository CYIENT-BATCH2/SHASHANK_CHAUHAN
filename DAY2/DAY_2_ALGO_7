The range is provided by the customer from 1990 to 2022
we need to check the number of leap years from the given range
so for that the given year should be divisible by 4
that is year % 4 sholud be zero that is the remainder sholud be zero
and we need to check other condition modulo by 400 should be zero or modulo by 100 should not be zero
if these condition satisfy its leap year
we can increment the count everytime when leap year is found
print the number of leap years
